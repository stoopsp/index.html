		<h1>Learning about the work Environment</h1>
		<p>I want to find information about the work environment and its culture from an ethnographic perspective. This is important because I believe understanding the complexities of the cultures fostered within work environments can lend a lot of important information that can aid in improving poor cultures, especially by understanding what impacts or influences it.</p>
