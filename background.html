		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>Anthropological research has produced a robust amount of research about organized labor, including subjects such as how unions impact workers, the effects of bureaucracy, and comparisons of values and attitudes in corporate settings.</p>
		<p>According to Paul Luff and Christian Heath, contemporary developments in work and organizations pose significant challenges for ethnography and qualitative research. They explain that due to so many different specialisms and occupations, transformations of the workspace, and deployment of advanced technology, what constitutes data needs to be addressed. As discussed by Susan Hopkinson and Debra Wiegand, studies within the nursing work environment bring understanding to the interruptions within its culture. A large part of this understanding, as they uncover, is the realization that interruptions are important to the culture, its practices, communication, and coordination.</p>
		<p>Something I see insufficient in these background studies is the impact or influence that different types of work environments can cause on the people within them. In my study, I want to look specifically at the direct impact culture has on its people and focus on understanding the effects to better understand how improvements could be made.</p>
