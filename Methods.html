		<h1>Method and Design</h1>
		<p>For the method and design, I believe using participant surveys, observations, analyses from unstructured field notes, and interview transcripts will be key methods of collecting data for this research. Since my study involves gathering information about the workplace and its culture, methods that involve communicating and observing the people that interact within these spaces would prove most critical to gathering important research. The people included in this research would be all different levels of the workplace; from the perspectives of part-time workers, employees, to higher positions such as supervisors and managers. For the interviews, I would choose seasoned veterans from the workplace of choice, and such questions I would ask are: describe the typical day at work, the politics and they play into the higher positions, describe the social interactions, and lastlyâ€”explain the workplace culture.</p>
		<p>By looking at these different levels, observations on how they affect the overall work environment could be made. A proportionate sample of subjects from each level across a select number of different jobs would be investigated using the highlighted methods. As for how long this research and observation of the workplace will take, I would say six months to a year. As for analysis, the results will be carefully examined, noting any patterns and potential connections based on what participants describe their workplace as. If there is an identifiable number of factors that contribute to an expressed poorly described work culture, then my hypothesis would be confirmed.</p>
