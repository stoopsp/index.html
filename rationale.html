		<h1>Rationale</h1>
		<p>By looking into the culture within work environments, information about possible impacting or influential factors could be discovered. If there is a pattern of identifiable factors seen in varying work environments, then a workplace's culture could be improved to foster a better attitude. If there are indeed identifiable factors, then this knowledge could be used to put in place improvements in poor workplace cultures. If there aren't, then improving upon poor workplace cultures will have been shown to be complex and special case-wise.</p>
