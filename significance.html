		<h1>Significance and Conclusion</h1>
		<p>Workers play an integral role in society, and as this study aims to shed more light on, the cultures that spawn out of these environments must also play an important part in the experience and lives of those working within them. The ethnographic field would be benefited from more analysis of the cultures that brood within these communities, especially today. This research could also aid in benefiting programs, policy, and the overall perspective given to the work environment, as well as informing others of potential improvements to former practices.</p>
